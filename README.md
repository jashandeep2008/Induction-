The second day at GNDEC started with an English Proficiency Test at 9:30 a.m., which went on till 10:30 a.m. This test helped check our English skills and see where we could improve. It was a nice way to understand our strengths and weaknesses in the language.

Right after that, the Mathematics Proficiency Test began at 10:30 a.m. and ended at 11:30 a.m. This test checked our basic maths knowledge and problem-solving skills. Both the English and Maths tests gave a clear idea of our current level before starting regular classes.

After the tests, we had a break from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. In the afternoon, we attended an expert lecture by Dr. Arashdeep Singh in the college auditorium on the topic “Food: A Pivotal Role in Students’ Overall Wellness.” The lecture was very interesting and taught us how healthy eating is important for both our body and mind.

The last session of the day was conducted by the Causmic Club, along with the launch of induction activities, from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. in the auditorium. The session was exciting and created a positive and energetic atmosphere. Overall, Day 2 was full of learning, motivation, and new experiences.

DAY-3 
The third day in college was very different and exciting. An expert lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, Incharge of IAPT, was held in the college auditorium from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. This lecture was very interesting, and all the students enjoyed it a lot.

Dr. Jaswinder Singh performed many different science experiments during the lecture. He explained science in a unique way, using experiments and practical examples. He also told  many mathematical tricks .This made learning fun and easy to understand, and students were excited throughout the session.

After that, there was another expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni on “Universal Human Values” in the auditorium from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. This lecture was inspiring and helped us understand the importance of human values in our daily life. Overall, it was a very interesting and meaningful day at college.

DAY – 4

Our very first college lecture began today with English, taught by Prof. Aastik Sharma. He warmly introduced himself and then encouraged every student to share a short self-introduction. We also spoke about why we selected this particular college and branch, which gave us a chance to reflect on our choices and aspirations. Through this interaction, we were able to recognize some of our own strengths and areas of improvement. Prof. Sharma further explained that English in our course will not be limited to grammar, but will focus on professional communication skills, an essential tool for our careers.

The next lecture was Chemistry by Prof. Karan Bhalla. He familiarized us with his subject and explained the evaluation system, attendance requirements, and MSTs (Mid-Semester Tests). He also asked us to think about our vision for the future and introduced us briefly to the idea of Universal Human Values, reminding us that personal growth is as important as academic success.

Later, we attended a session by Dr. Priya Darshani Ma’am. She highlighted the difference between happiness and excitement, explaining why happiness is more stable and meaningful. She spoke about the cycle of excitement—starting from indulgence, moving to depression, and finally escape—and encouraged us to look within ourselves using natural acceptance and imagination. She also described how our desires are shaped by pre-conditioning, sensory experiences, and personal choices.

Towards the evening, our seniors introduced us to the Causmic Club. They talked about its activities and projects and also guided us about choosing a suitable laptop for our academic and professional journey.

DAY – 5

The day started with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) session handled by our seniors. They introduced us to the fundamentals of C++ programming, explaining concepts such as datatypes, algorithms, pseudo-code, flowcharts, and logical steps for solving problems. Their way of teaching made the subject much more approachable.

After that, we had a lecture on BEEE (Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering) by Prof. Simranjeet Kaur. She began with her introduction and then explained the syllabus in detail. We also had a round of student introductions, which made the class more interactive.

The last lecture of the day was Physics. Here, we introduced ourselves again, and the professor explained which topics would be essential for the laboratory experiments that we would perform later.

DAY – 6

Our first class was Mathematics, taken by Prof. Sukhminder Singh. He introduced us to some modern tools such as GeoGebra and Wolfram Alpha, which are extremely useful in solving advanced mathematical problems, plotting graphs, and creating 2D/3D models. He even gave us a practical exercise to draw a circle and parabola, and later guided us on constructing a sphere using these applications. The session made mathematics feel engaging and creative.

The following session was conducted by our seniors, where they continued teaching us C++ basics. They explained the use of cin and cout for input and output in coding. A few tasks were given to us, and with their support, we were able to solve them successfully.

Later, Sr. Gurcharan Singh Grewal, trustee of the college and SGPC member, formally welcomed us. He informed us about the hostel facilities, teaching staff, and the strict anti-ragging policy, which gave us a sense of comfort as newcomers.

The day ended with an inspiring talk by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khanna, the in-charge of CML (Central Media Lab). He introduced us to various opportunities for extra learning, especially the Swayam-NPTEL platform, which provides free online courses and certificates valuable for future job opportunities.

DAY – 7

The morning session was led by Dr. Parminder Singh (Dean Student Welfare). He gave us a detailed presentation about the college infrastructure. We learned about the sports complex, hostel accommodations, medical dispensary, canteens, and other facilities, which made us feel more connected to the campus.

The second lecture was conducted by Dr. Amit Kamra, who is in charge of the Digital Marketing Club (DMC). He explained the objectives of the club and showcased a few videos created by students. He motivated us to contribute to the growth of our college’s reputation and visibility.

Afterwards, Dr. Randhir Singh guided us through the examination process, explaining how tests and evaluations are managed.

Later, our seniors held another P2P session, where we practiced coding using operators and conditional statements (if, else, and else-if). They also gave us small assignments to practice independently.

The day concluded with a Chemistry lecture by Prof. Karan Bhalla, where we began the topic of Water Chemistry, focusing on hardness, softness, and Reverse Osmosis (RO).

DAY – 9

The day started with Mathematics by Pragya Ma’am, who clearly explained the syllabus, marking scheme, and evaluation criteria. She also began teaching the first topic, giving us a smooth start to the subject.

In the next class, Chemistry, Amandeep Ma’am introduced herself and shared her teaching methodology. She explained the syllabus thoroughly and gave us tips on how to prepare effectively.

After this, we had another BEEE lecture, where we learned about resistances connected in series and parallel, along with some basic network-related terminology.

The last session of the day was English with Parmeet Ma’am. She introduced herself and made the lecture lively by involving us in an interactive classroom activity, which gave us a chance to communicate confidently.
